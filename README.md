ADVProgressBar design documentation
====================================

On any regular repository, the **gh-pages** branch has a special meaning for GitHub:
any content pushed here, will automatically published to the project GitHub Pages.

I use GitHub Pages feature to create the project **documentation** site,
that can be found [here] (http://corerd.github.com/ADVProgressBar).
