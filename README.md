ADVProgressBar for iOS design documentation
===========================================

On any regular repository, the **gh-pages** branch has a special meaning for GitHub:
any content pushed here, will automatically published to the project GitHub Pages.
The instructions can be found at
[Creating Project Pages manually]
(https://help.github.com/articles/creating-project-pages-manually).

I use GitHub Pages feature to create the project **documentation** site,
that can be found [here] (http://corerd.github.com/ADVProgressBar).
